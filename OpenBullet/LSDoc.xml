    <item name="What is LoliScript?">
LoliScript (LS) is a custom scripting language made to give access to all existing (plus some more advanced) capabilities of OpenBullet.
      
Every instruction is a one-liner (but can be broken down into multiple segments for readability) and it will integrate the existing block execution capabilities with some other that cannot be reproduced with normal blocks.
      
This is ABSOLUTELY NOT a fully functional scripting language meant to replace the capabilities offered by JavaScript or Python.
      
Here's an example of a LoliScript command:
PRINT Hello, World!
      
And here's how you would execute a standard Function Block:
FUNCTION Constant "Hello, World!" -> VAR "GREETING"
      
In this documentation you will learn how to use LoliScript to its full potential and integrate it with your other blocks or even stop using blocks altogether!
    </item>
    <item name="When to use it">
You should use LoliScript when:
• you need more powerful tools to build a config
• you want something faster and much easier to debug at a glance
• you don't want to deal with clicking on tens of blocks in big configs
    </item>
	</section>
  <section name="Syntax">
    <item name="Introduction">
LoliScript has a linear syntax where each line is a command.
      
Example:
FUNCTION Constant "Hello, World!" -> VAR "GREETING"
      
Indentation will be considered as a continuation of the previous line, so writing something like:
FUNCTION Constant
  "Hello, World!"
  -> VAR "GREETING"
is completely equivalent to the one-liner above.

Optional arguments will be wrapped with square brackets [ ] and they don't need to be set each time.

Every command follows this scheme:
CMDID [ARGUMENTS]

CMDID uniquely identifies a command or flow control statement by its name
[ARGUMENTS] can have different types and they are used to customize the command you want to execute
    </item>
    <item name="Argument Types">
The arguments can be of 4 types:

• Parameter (usually identifies an enumerator value)
FUNCTION Hash SHA512 ...

• Numeric (usually an integer)
FUNCTION RandomNum 0 100 ...

• Boolean (a parameter name (case sensitive!) followed by =True or =False)
KEYCHECK BanOn4XX=True BanOnTocheck=False

• Literal (corresponds to a string argument)
FUNCTION Constant "Hello" ...
Note that you will have to escape double quotes inside a literal, for example
FUNCTION Constant "This is how to \"escape\" double quotes" ...

• Redirector (used to direct the output to a variable or a file)
FUNCTION Constant "Hello" -> VAR "GREETING"
FUNCTION Constant "Hello" -> CAP "Greeting"
    </item>
    <item name="Variables">
You can access the saved values of variables and use them in literals by including them in angle brackets like this &lt;A&gt;.

There are 3 types of variables:
Single
List
Dictionary

Examples (NAME is the variable name):
- Single
&lt;NAME&gt;
- List (access one element by index or all element using * as index)
&lt;NAME[0]&gt;
&lt;NAME[*]&gt;
- Dictionary (access by key using () and by value using {}, supports *)
&lt;NAME(key)&gt;
&lt;NAME{value}&gt;
&lt;NAME(*)&gt;
&lt;NAME{*}&gt;
    </item>
    <item name="Comments">
Every line that starts with two #s is considered a comment

Example:
## THIS IS A COMMENT
    </item>
  </section>
  <section name="General Commands">
    <item name="PRINT">
This command is peculiar since it doesn't take a literal argument but just parses the rest of the line after the keyword PRINT and outputs it to the debugger log.

Syntax:
PRINT TEXT

Example:
PRINT Hello, World!
    </item>
    <item name="SET">
This command is very powerful as it allows manipulation on the global data of the bot.

Syntax:
SET IDENTIFIER [PARAMETERS]

Allowed identifiers:
SOURCE - The stored response source of the last request performed
STATUS - The status of the bot
RESPONSECODE - The response code of the last request performed
COOKIE - Sets the value for a cookie of the global cookie jar given its name
ADDRESS - The address of the response of the last request performed
USEPROXY - Whether to use the proxy that is currently assigned to the bot during requests
PROXY - Sets the current proxy
PROXYTYPE - Sets the current proxy type
DATA - Sets the current data
VAR - Sets a variable
CAP - Sets a captured data
NEWGVAR - Initializes a new global variable (only if it doesn't exist)
GVAR - Sets a global variable's value
GCOOKIES - Sets cookies from the local cookie jar into the global cookie jar

Examples:
SET SOURCE "Example Source"
SET STATUS SUCCESS
SET STATUS CUSTOM "ABCD"
SET RESPONSECODE 200
SET COOKIE "token" "abcdef"
SET ADDRESS "https://www.google.com"
SET USEPROXY FALSE

SET GCOOKIES

    </item>
    <item name="DELETE">
This command allows you to delete elements from current collections.

Syntax:
DELETE IDENTIFIER [CONDITION] "LITERAL"

Allowed identifiers:
COOKIE
VAR
GVAR

  <section name="Flow Control">
    <item name="If Else">
The IF statement will check the condition after it. If it's successful, it will continue to the next instruction, otherwise it will jump to the first ELSE or ENDIF statement.
The ELSE statement will be executed if the IF wasn't successful, otherwise it will jump to the first ENDIF statement.

## OTHER COMMANDS
ENDIF

You can add an ELSE command too like this:
IF "STRING1" CONDITION "STRING2"

    <item name="While">
The WHILE statement will check the condition after it. If it's successful, it will continue to the next instruction, otherwise it will jump to the first ENDWHILE statement.
The ENDWHILE statement will always jump back to the first WHILE statement above it.
The WHILE - ENDWHILE pair allows to reproduce the FOR statement of common high level programming languages as well.

JUMP #LABEL
    </item>
    <item name="Begin (End) Script">
The BEGIN SCRIPT statement will mark an area of the script where the commands will be executed using another scripting language.
The OUTPUTS literal can contain a comma-separated list of variable names that you want to extract from the script's scope and declare inside OB as strings or lists.
It is useful to mention that your normal variables will be automatically declared inside the script as strings / lists of strings / dictionaries (if their name is allowed by that language's standards).
Available languages:
JavaScript
IronPython

Syntax:
BEGIN SCRIPT LANGUAGE
[script here]
END SCRIPT -> VARS "OUTPUTS"

Example:
BEGIN SCRIPT JavaScript
var a = 1+2;
var b = 'hello';
END SCRIPT -> VARS "a,b"
    </item>
